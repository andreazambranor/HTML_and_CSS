			First, I am going to tell you a bit about <snap style= color:orange; font-style:italic; text-decoration-line:underline;> Bonnie </snap>
			<br> Bonnie is a very old dog, she is around 17 years and was rescued when she was just 2.
			<br> She is a very sweet and lovely dog, she gets scared easily and likes to take short walks.

			Then there's <snap style=color:orange; font-style:italic; text-decoration-line:underline;> Bombon. </snap>
			<br> My other dog is a small pekingese. &nbsp; She is very small and very loud.
			<br> She loves to take long walks and cuddle, but sometime she is too loud.
